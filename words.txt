In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit point Not a nasty comma dirty comma wet hole comma filled with the
ends of worms and an oozy smell comma nor yet a dry comma bare comma sandy hole with nothing in it to sit
down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole comma and that means comfort point
It had a perfectly round door like a porthole comma painted green comma with a shiny yellow brass
knob in the exact middle point The door opened on to a tubeshaped hall like a tunnel: a very
comfortable tunnel without smoke comma with panelled walls comma and floors tiled and carpeted comma
provided with polished chairs comma and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats - the hobbit
was fond of visitors point The tunnel wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into
the side of the hill - The Hill comma as all the people for many miles round called it - and many
little round doors opened out of it comma first on one side and then on another point No going
upstairs for the hobbit: bedrooms comma bathrooms comma cellars comma pantries (lots of these) comma wardrobes
(he had whole rooms devoted to clothes) comma kitchens comma dining-rooms comma all were on the same
floor comma and indeed on the same passage point The best rooms were all on the left-hand side
(going in) comma for these were the only ones to have windows comma deep-set round windows
looking over his garden and meadows beyond comma sloping down to the river point End
